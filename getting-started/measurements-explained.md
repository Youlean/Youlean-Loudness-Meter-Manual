# Measurements Explained

Youlean Loudness Meter 2 is equipped with a comprehensive set of measurements essential for audio production and broadcasting. Here's an overview of its key measurement capabilities, including those specific to dialogue:

### **Momentary Loudness (LUFS):**

Measures average loudness over 400 milliseconds, ideal for monitoring rapid loudness fluctuations.

### **Short-term Loudness (LUFS):**

Averages loudness over a 3-second period, useful for evaluating specific parts of a track, like verses or choruses.

### **Integrated Loudness (LUFS):**

Calculates the average loudness over the entire duration of a track or segment, essential for broadcasting and streaming platform compliance.

### **True Peak Level (dBTP):**

Detects the maximum level of audio signal peaks to prevent digital clipping and distortion.

### **Loudness Range (LRA):**

Measures the difference between the quietest and loudest parts of a track, indicating its dynamic range.

### **Average Dynamics (PLR):**

This ratio reflects the difference between the peak level and integrated loudness, providing insights into the overall dynamics of the track.

### **Dynamics (PSR):**

Offers real-time insights into the dynamic processing of the audio by measuring the instantaneous difference between peak and loudness levels.

### **Integrated Dialogue Gated Loudness:**

Specifically measures the integrated loudness of dialogue within a program. This is crucial for content where dialogue clarity and consistency are key, such as in film and TV production.

### **Dialogue Gated LRA:**

Calculates the loudness range of dialogue content by focusing on the parts where dialogue is present. This measurement is vital for understanding the dynamic range of speech in mixed audio content.

### **Dialogue Percentage:**

Indicates the percentage of the program's duration that contains dialogue. This metric is particularly useful in assessing the balance between dialogue and other elements in the audio mix, such as music or sound effects.

It's important to note that **LUFS (Loudness Units Full Scale)** and **LKFS (Loudness, K-weighted, relative to Full Scale)** are essentially the same measurement. The difference between these two terms lies not in the measurement technique or the result, but rather in how different countries or organizations prefer to refer to this measurement.

* **LUFS** is the term more commonly used in European and international standards.
* **LKFS** is often used in the United States, following the terminology of the ITU (International Telecommunication Union).

Despite this variation in terminology, both LUFS and LKFS adhere to the same reference scale and measurement parameters. In practice, this means that a measurement in LUFS is directly equivalent to a measurement in LKFS.
