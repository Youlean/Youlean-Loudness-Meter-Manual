After installing the plugins, you need to load Youlean Loudness Meter 2 inside your preferred DAW. The following plugin types are supported: **VST2, VST3, AU, AAX**.

- **Placement**: The plugin should be placed at the last position on the master mixer bus.
- **Enable Playback**: Once the plugin is inserted, enable playback by pressing play in your DAW to see the loudness measurements.

> **Note**: The master fader must be set to 0dB, as it applies volume correction after all plugins in the mixer chain, which can lead to inaccurate loudness measurements if not set properly.
