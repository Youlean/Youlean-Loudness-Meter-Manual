# License Activation

### **Personal or business usage**

The PRO version of the Youlean Loudness Meter comes as a single license, with flexible usage terms tailored for both individual and business users.

* **Personal Usage**: For individual users, the license can be applied across multiple personal devices, supporting those who work on various platforms.
* **Business Usage**: In a business setting, the same license is restricted to a single machine but allows unlimited users on that device, making it suitable for team environments or studios where the meter is accessed by multiple people.

This approach ensures that the license adapts to both personal and professional needs.

### Making license available for all users on a single computer

If you purchased the license as a business, you are required to have a separate license for every machine. You can however make a license available for all users.
